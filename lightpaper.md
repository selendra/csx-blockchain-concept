# CSX Blockchain: Empowering and Modernizing Cambodia's Financial Market for Everyone

## Abstract

This lightpaper presents a comprehensive blockchain-based solution to modernize the Cambodia Securities Exchange (CSX). It addresses current challenges such as low trading volumes, limited accessibility, and the absence of fractional shares. The proposed system leverages blockchain technology, smart contracts, and a user-friendly interface to create a more inclusive, efficient, and transparent stock market.

Key features include a streamlined investor onboarding process with social login and tiered KYC, fractional share ownership, a CSX stablecoin, and micro trading fees. The paper outlines the technical architecture, regulatory considerations, and implementation strategy. It also discusses the potential economic impact, exploring how this innovation could increase market participation, improve capital access for companies, and contribute to Cambodia's overall economic development.

The lightpaper aims to demonstrate how CSX can position itself at the forefront of financial innovation in Southeast Asia, creating a more dynamic and accessible capital market for all Cambodians.
