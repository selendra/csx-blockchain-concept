# Executive Summary: CSX Blockchain - Modernized Cambodia's Stock Market


The Cambodia Securities Exchange (CSX) faces significant challenges that hinder its growth and accessibility to the broader Cambodian population. This litepaper presents an innovative blockchain-based solution to address these issues and modernize Cambodia's stock market.

## Current Challenges

1. Low Trading Volume: The CSX currently experiences low trading volumes, primarily due to a cumbersome investor onboarding process that creates a high entry barrier for potential investors.

2. Lack of Fractional Shares: The absence of fractional shares prevents small investors from fully utilizing their savings. For example, with a share price of 7,000 KHR and a monthly investment budget of 100,000 KHR, an investor can only purchase 14 shares, leaving 2,000 KHR uninvested. Scaled up, this could result in millions of dollars of potential investments remaining idle.

3. Limited Accessibility: The current system's complexity and high entry points discourage many Cambodians from participating in the stock market, limiting their investment options and the flow of capital to listed companies.

## Proposed Solution: CSX Blockchain

We propose a comprehensive blockchain-based solution to transform the CSX into a more accessible, efficient, and inclusive platform:

1. Streamlined Onboarding: Implement social login (Google, Telegram, Facebook) with Account Abstraction, allowing instant account creation and a tiered KYC system for progressive access.

2. Fractional Shares: Enable fractional share ownership through tokenization, allowing investors to utilize their entire investment budget and potentially increasing overall market liquidity.

3. User-Friendly Interface: Develop intuitive, multi-platform interfaces (mobile apps, web apps, Telegram mini-app) to make stock trading as easy as online shopping.

4. CSX Stablecoin: Introduce a KHR-pegged stablecoin to facilitate seamless transactions and enable 24/7 trading.

5. Smart Contract-Powered Trading: Utilize blockchain smart contracts for transparent, efficient, and near-instantaneous trade execution and settlement.

6. Broker Integration: Collaborate with existing brokers, providing them with new tools and incentives to participate in the modernized system.

## Goals and Expected Outcomes

1. Increased Market Participation: Lower entry barriers to attract a broader range of investors, from students to professionals.

2. Higher Trading Volumes: Enable more efficient use of investment capital and attract new investors to significantly increase trading volumes.

3. Improved Capital Access for Companies: Provide listed companies with better access to capital by tapping into a larger, more diverse investor base.

4. Financial Inclusion: Educate and empower more Cambodians to participate in the stock market, diversifying their savings and investment options.

5. Economic Growth: Contribute to Cambodia's economic development by fostering a more robust and accessible capital market.

CSX aims to transform Cambodia's stock market into a dynamic, inclusive, and technologically advanced financial ecosystem. This initiative has the potential to democratize stock market participation, boost economic growth, and position Cambodia as a leader in innovative financial technologies in Southeast Asia. Through this comprehensive modernization, CSX is poised to catalyze a new era of financial engagement and economic prosperity for Cambodia.
